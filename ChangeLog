version 0.9-8 2013-12-31

 - Some linearisation variance estimators for the ratio point estimator are added.
 - Restrictions on the input of n and N (sample and population sizes) are relaxed. It is
   no longer needed that they are (formally) integers. They now can be double-precision
   scalars with zero-valued fractional parts.
 - When using the Tukey's Jackknife it is now optional to utilise a finite population co-
   rrection (PFC). A logical argument that indicates whether to use it or not was added
   to those functions that implement Tukey's jackknife variance estimators.
 - Some polishing of the user's manual.

 - Some variance estimators for the intercept regression coefficient point estimator are added.
 - Some polishing of the user's manual.


version 0.9-6 2013-09-03
