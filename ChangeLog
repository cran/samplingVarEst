version 1.2 2018-09-21

 - A simple performance optimization is made in all routines, replacing 'any(is.na(x))' by 'anyNA(x)' for speed. Note that this needs R >= 3.1.0. See: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6551825/fastest-way-to-detect-if-vector-has-at-least-1-na
 - Some surely useless 'as.double()' or 'as.integer()' were removed in all routines.



version 1.1 2017-07-10

 - There was a problem with the C code for the Pk.PropNorm.U function (in some cases the sum of the output vector did not match the sample size). It is now fixed.
 - The CRAN check package submission NOTE: "Found no calls to: 'R_registerRoutines', 'R_useDynamicSymbols'" is now fixed.
 - Some polishing of the user's manual.



version 1.0-2 2016-06-12

 - Negative values of the MOS variable (VecMOS.U) are converted to zero before when computing inclusion probabilities using the function Pk.PropNorm.U.
 - Some polishing of the user's manual.



version 1.0-1 2016-01-02

 - Two point estimators for the empirical cumulative distribution function were added.
 - Some polishing of the user's manual.



version 0.9-9 2014-05-13

 - Updated maintainer's email address.



version 0.9-8 2013-12-31

 - Some linearisation variance estimators for the ratio point estimator are added.
 - Restrictions on the input of n and N (sample and population sizes) are relaxed. It is no longer needed that they are (formally) integers. They now can be double-precision scalars with zero-valued fractional parts.
 - When using the Tukey's Jackknife it is now optional to utilise a finite population correction (PFC). A logical argument that indicates whether to use it or not was added to those functions that implement Tukey's jackknife variance estimators.
 - Some polishing of the user's manual.



version 0.9-7 2013-12-14

 - A point estimator for the intercept regression coefficient is added.
 - Some variance estimators for the intercept regression coefficient point estimator are added.
 - Some polishing of the user's manual.



version 0.9-6 2013-09-03

 - Updated references and some polishing of the user's manual.
 - First ChangeLog entry.
