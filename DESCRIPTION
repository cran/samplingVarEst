Description: Functions to calculate some point estimators and estimating their variance under unequal probability sampling without replacement. Single and two stage sampling designs are considered. Some approximations for the second order inclusion probabilities (joint inclusion probabilities) are available (sample and population based). A variety of Jackknife variance estimators are implemented. Almost every function is written in C (compiled) code for faster results. The functions incorporate some performance improvements for faster results with large datasets.
