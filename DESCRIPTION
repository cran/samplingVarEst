Description: Functions to calculate some point estimators and estimate their variance under unequal probability sampling without replacement. Single and two-stage sampling designs are considered. Some approximations for the second-order inclusion probabilities (joint inclusion probabilities) are available (sample and population based). A variety of Jackknife variance estimators are implemented. Almost every function is written in C (compiled) code for faster results. The functions incorporate some performance improvements for faster results with large datasets.
